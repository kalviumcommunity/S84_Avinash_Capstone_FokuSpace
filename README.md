# üìö FocusGuard: A Distraction-Limiting Study Companion

## üß† Project Idea & Description

**FocusGuard** is a cross-platform productivity application designed to help students and professionals stay focused by limiting distractions during study or work sessions. It includes a desktop application built with **Electron.js**, and a user-facing website built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.

The core idea is to create a **custom-themed workspace** where users can:
- **Whitelist only certain apps** (e.g., VSCode, Chrome, Figma) during focus sessions.
- **Block distractions** (e.g., games, social media).
- **Lock themselves into the workspace** for a set duration.
- **Exit only using a predefined token/password**.
- View personalized recommendations or focus summaries (optional AI integration).

The companion **website** provides:
- An engaging landing page to learn about Fokus Space.
- A secure **sign-up/login system** to download the app.
- A **contact page**, **user comment section**, and **dashboard** after login.
